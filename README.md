# 🔐 Password Generator & Manager (Tkinter GUI)

This is a Python-based password generator and manager with a graphical user interface built using Tkinter. It helps you create strong, secure passwords and store them alongside the corresponding website information in a `.docx` file.

## 🚀 Features

* Generate strong, random passwords
* Input and associate passwords with specific websites
* Save all credentials in a well-formatted `.docx` file
* Easy-to-use GUI built with Tkinter

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Tkinter (for GUI)
* `python-docx` (for writing to `.docx` files)
* `secrets` and `string` modules for secure password generation

## 📦 Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-manager-gui.git

   ```

2. Install required libraries:

   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash

   ```

## 💡 How It Works

1. Launch the app with `main.py`
2. Enter the website name
3. Click the **Generate Password** button
4. Click **Save** to store the website and generated password in a `.docx` file

## 📁 Output

All passwords and their associated websites are stored in a file named `passwords.docx`, saved in the same directory as the script.

Website: example.com  
Password: 8jA!zP3d@1xW
